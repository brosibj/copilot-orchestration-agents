# Copilot Orchestration Agents

A GitHub Copilot agent template for structured, multi-phase AI-driven development workflows. Designed to be adapted per project.


## Overview

This repository provides a complete set of GitHub Copilot Chat agent definitions (`.agent.md` files) that implement a repeatable development workflow:

```
@quick                                  ← simple tasks (single-pass)
@discover  →  @build  →  @finalize     ← standard tasks (multi-phase)
```

Each phase is an orchestrator that fans work out to focused sub-agents, enforces quality gates, and hands off structured artifacts to the next phase. Agents are model-assigned by task complexity, and validation is built into the loop rather than bolted on at the end. Orchestrators are lean coordinators — they do not read file contents, relying instead on concise subagent return summaries for routing decisions (`@quick` is the exception as a hybrid worker). When one orchestrator completes, it prompts for handoff to the next orchestrator with a structured artifact set.

Four orchestrators are user-invokable: `@quick` for simple tasks, and the `@discover` → `@build` → `@finalize` pipeline for standard tasks. Orchestrators do not specify a model — the user chooses based on the scope and size of the requested changes. All sub-agents are model-assigned and invoked by the orchestrators.


## Features

### What it helps with:
- **Consistent, repeatable development** — the same planning, implementation, validation, and documentation steps are enforced on every task, regardless of who invokes them.
- **Right-sized model usage** — slower reasoning models handle architecture and ambiguity; faster models handle narrow, well-scoped tasks like triage and classification.
- **Parallel execution** — independent sub-agents (research workers, validator + reviewer) run concurrently, reducing total wall-clock time per task.
- **Structured artifact trail** — every task produces `research.md`, `plan.md`, `report.md`, and `pr.md`, making decisions traceable.
- **History-based doc refresh** — the `update-docs-from-history` skill can reconcile `README.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, prompts, and workflow docs from branch diffs or PR context without inventing unsupported rationale.
- **Context-aware UI validation** — `@validator` can open, read, navigate, and screenshot UI pages when needed via browser tooling, keeping tests targeted to the scale of the UI change.
- **Standards enforcement** — agents rely on the same auto-loaded instruction files, so code style, test patterns, error handling, and UI conventions stay consistent.
- **Context window management** — orchestrators are lean coordinators that do not read file contents. All analysis is delegated to subagents, which return concise structured summaries. This prevents context bloat in the orchestrator.
- **Consistent steps** — validation, testing, and code review are wired into the loop; they cannot be bypassed without the orchestrator failing its output check.
- **Regression Prevention** — all debuggers are required to write a failing regression test before applying a fix (if testing methodology is defined).
- **Tracking deferred work** — `@deferred-tracker` catalogs non-blocking issues as GitHub issues before the task closes.
- **Prevention of scope creep** — the complexity gate routes simple tasks to `@quick`, preventing heavyweight phases from being invoked unnecessarily, while thorough requirements building keeps the scope of standard tasks well-defined and bounded.


## Getting Started

Agent files are project-agnostic — all project-specific settings live in `.github/instructions/` using standard `*.instructions.md` files. To adapt this template:

### 1. Run `/init-project`

The recommended way to set up instruction files. The `/init-project` slash prompt gathers project facts (stack, build commands, test framework, UI library, etc.) and creates or updates the active instruction files from their templates. Re-run when project setup changes.

### 2. Populate active instruction files

`/init-project` creates these in `.github/instructions/` from templates in `agents/templates/` based on recommended separation of concerns. Customize as needed. Instruction files are not referenced directly, so additional instruction files can be added for framework-specific guidance or anti-patterns. See the What Lives Where section for more details.

| Priority | File | What to customize |
|:---|:---|:---|
| **Always** | `instructions/project.instructions.md` | Tech stack, build/migration commands, error handling, coding standards, data access patterns, MCP tool guidance, debugger tier scoping |
| **If UI** | `instructions/styleguide.instructions.md` | UI library, component conventions, component data access patterns, CSS approach |
| **If tests** | `instructions/testing.instructions.md` | Test framework, test commands, project names, assertion libraries, builders, anti-patterns |

### 3. Update MCP tools (if applicable)

If your project uses different MCP tool extensions (e.g., replacing `radzen.mcp/*` with a different UI library's MCP), update the `tools:` list in the frontmatter of affected agent files. Agents infer tool purpose from names and descriptions, so no instruction text changes are needed — only the frontmatter `tools:` arrays.

### 4. Add new instruction files or skills when needed

Place additional instruction files in `.github/instructions/` with focused `applyTo` scopes for auto-loading. For framework-specific anti-patterns or lifecycle guidance, create a new skill under `.github/skills/` (see existing skills for format).

> The slash prompts in `prompts/` work out-of-the-box. `/init-project` seeds or refreshes instructions, `/bug-report` and `/new-feature` route straight into `@discover`, and `/quick-fix` jumps into `@quick`; see the matching prompt files [init-project.prompt.md](.github/prompts/init-project.prompt.md), [bug-report.prompt.md](.github/prompts/bug-report.prompt.md), [new-feature.prompt.md](.github/prompts/new-feature.prompt.md), and [quick-fix.prompt.md](.github/prompts/quick-fix.prompt.md) when customizing.


## Workflow

### Quick Path — `@quick`

**Invoke with:** a description of the simple task, or `{task-slug}` if `@discover` already produced `research.md`.

Single-pass orchestrator for tasks that touch ≤ 3 files, require no schema changes, and need no new dependencies. Handles discovery, implementation, validation, and finalization in one invocation without dispatching heavyweight subagents.

**Output:** `plans/{task-slug}/research.md` and `plans/{task-slug}/pr.md`. Optionally creates/updates a PR.

### Phase 1 — `@discover`

**Invoke with:** a description of the feature or bug.

Orchestrates discovery and planning:

1. **Requirements** — `@requirements-builder` formalizes intent, acceptance criteria, suggests research scopes, and returns a **complexity classification** (Simple or Standard).
2. **Bug triage** — `@triage` classifies bugs to the correct debugger tier (if applicable). Tier 2+ bugs are upgraded to Standard regardless of the initial classification.
3. **Simple path** — if classified Simple (and tier 1 or no triage), produce `research.md` and hand off to `@quick`. `@quick` performs its own inline research.
4. **Parallel research** (Standard only) — The orchestrator dispatches multiple `@researcher` instances in parallel (one per scope from requirements). Each writes a fragment file. A final `@researcher` compile pass merges fragments into `research.md`.
5. **Planning** (Standard only) — `@planner` produces a step-by-step plan with scope, sequencing, and test requirements.

**Output:** `plans/{task-slug}/research.md` and (for Standard tasks) `plans/{task-slug}/plan.md`.


### Phase 2 — `@build`

**Invoke with:** `{task-slug}` from `@discover`.

Orchestrates execution and validation:

1. **Pre-flight** — dispatches `@researcher` to summarize `plan.md` and return routing info (schema changes, step order, task type).
2. **Migration** (if needed) — `@migrator` handles schema changes with clean history.
3. **Implementation** — routes to specialized implementers by file scope (UI, service/backend, or mixed).
3. **Bug path** — dispatches the appropriate debugger tier per triage classification; auto-escalates if needed.
4. **Validation** — `@validator` (build, tests, requirements coverage) and `@reviewer` (code quality) run in parallel, each returning findings to the orchestrator. The orchestrator merges results and writes `report.md`.

**Output:** `plans/{task-slug}/report.md`. Loops on failures before surfacing to user (max 5 retries).


### Phase 3 — `@finalize`

**Invoke with:** `{task-slug}` from `@build`.

Orchestrates finalization:

1. **Documentation** — `@documenter` updates project `README.md`, instruction-layer guidance, and related workflow docs if behavior changed. Documentation effort is proportional to change size.
2. **Deferred tracking** — `@deferred-tracker` catalogs non-blocking issues. The orchestrator prompts the user to approve which items become GitHub issues (multi-select, batched).
3. **PR description** — `@deferred-tracker` writes `plans/{task-slug}/pr.md` scaled to change size. The orchestrator asks the user: Create new PR / Update existing / Skip.


> **Session management note:** After a major phase gate or before dispatching the next orchestrator, run `/compact focus on {task-slug} plan decisions and implementation progress` to trim history while preserving routing data; the Session Management section of [agents/shared/workflow-rules.md](agents/shared/workflow-rules.md#L82-L87) spells out the checklist and artifact expectations.

> [!NOTE]
> Models chosen for each role based on strengths of the model. Each agent file lists primary + fallback models for rate-limiting resilience.

> [!TIP]
> The orchestrators are model-agnostic. The user chooses the model for each phase based on task complexity and size. Sub-agents are model-assigned to ensure the right model is used for each role. If a subagent defines a model with a higher multiplier cost than what is used for the orchestrator, the higher cost model will be considered "unavailable" (This is intended [functionality built into GitHub Copilot itself](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/issues/295449#issuecomment-3979023134)). The subagent will attempt to use an equivalent costing fallback model defined in the agent file. If no equivalent fallback model is available, the subagent will use the model chosen for the orchestrator instead of its default model for the subagent. 


## Bug Debugging Tiers

| Tier | Agent | Scope | Budget |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | `@debugger-medic` | Compiler/syntax/null | 2 passes |
| 2 | `@debugger-detective` | UI framework state/lifecycle/race | 3 passes |
| 3 | `@debugger-specialist` | Data/ORM/API routing | 3 passes |
| 4 | `@debugger-forensic` | DI/architecture/memory-leak | 5 passes |

Triage (`@triage`) selects the lowest-cost appropriate tier. Debugger tier scoping is defined in the active project instructions so it can be customized per project. If a tier exceeds its budget, it returns an escalation signal to the orchestrator. All debugger tiers write a regression test before applying the fix.


## Artifact Protocol

All artifacts live under `plans/{task-slug}/`. All artifacts are treated as ephemeral and are git-ignored (see this repo's `.gitignore`). Agents reference prior artifacts rather than restating their content, to enforce full context, and allow for idempotent restarts.

| File | Produced by | Consumed by |
|:---|:---|:---|
| `research.md` | `@discover` (or `@quick`) | `@build`, `@finalize` |
| `fragments/*.md` | `@researcher` instances | `@researcher` (compile pass) |
| `plan.md` | `@discover` | `@build`, `@finalize` |
| `report.md` | `@build` | `@finalize` |
| `diagnosis.md` | debuggers | `@build` |
| `pr.md` | `@finalize` (or `@quick`) | Pull request |

A missing expected artifact is considered a hard failure. Orchestrators will retry once before surfacing the failure to the user.
